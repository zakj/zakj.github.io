ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º Zak springs forth, product of the unholy union between an Aussie and an American.
I was born in Australia to an American father and an Australian/English mother.

1984-06: San Diego
Australia cannot contain Zak and his family for longâ€¦ though he still misses proper fish & chips.

1989-12: Portland
When my parents split, I moved northwards with Mum. Technically, I was living in
Vancouver, WAâ€“a small suburb of Portland with not much else going for it.

1998-04: San Diego
Back to San Diego, to spend some time with my dad and engage in a brief tryst
with higher education.

2000-01: Washington, DC
I dropped out of school to move to the east coast, kicking off an information
security startup and thereby losing faith in anyone's ability to keep secrets.

2004-05: San Francisco
After realizing that the parts of my job I loved most involved automating myself
away, I pivoted into full-time web development. I started working at
<a href="https://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>, and later began consulting.

ðŸŒ´ Zak joins Bek at GOOD, having been lured back to southern California.

ðŸ§— An excursion to the woods to build Cabin.

ðŸŒ² Clean air and green trees summon him northwards. A blur of school.
ðŸ§— Silicon Forestâ€”home to our favorite espresso, exquisite cuisine, and unstoppable green.

Hello again, sunshine! Some things are just too good not to play on repeat.

2014-11: San Francisco
The verdict is in! San Francisco, we're yours.
