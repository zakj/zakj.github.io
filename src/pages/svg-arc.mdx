# SVG arc paths

I often write SVGs by hand, and struggle with building arcs (`A` and `a`) due to
their argument structure. This little tool allows for specifying the start/end
angles instead of start/end coordinates. The output path assumes a `viewBox` of
`0 0 100 100` with the arc's circle at the center; use the additional fields to
change those assumptions.
