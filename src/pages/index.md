# Whiskey<br>ginger &<br>a dash of<br>bitters.

Hello! I'm Zak, a design-minded engineer in Oakland, CA. I currently lead
[Grammarly][]'s North America core product team. I have been building/breaking
things on the web since the mid-90s, previously with companies like [Mixpanel][]
and [Etsy][].

I have various interests, including but not limited to: motorcycling, yoga,
[hammock camping][camping], text editors, significant whitespace, making lists,
[grammar][], and sitting quietly.

Find me on [GitHub][], [LinkedIn][], or [via email][email].
