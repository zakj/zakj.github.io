  - company: GOOD
    location: Los Angeles
    title: Senior Software Engineer
    from: January 2011
    to: March 2011
    description: >
      In the midst of a variety of consulting gigs with GOOD, I converted
      briefly to a full-time employee to lead the charge cleaning up their web
      stack. I tracked down and fixed various bugs in the old (PHP-based) back
      end while working closely with designers and editors to implement new
      features. I also kicked off a migration to Ruby on Rails 3
      service-oriented architecture on the back end and Backbone on the front
      end, with a successful staged rollout and features running in parallel on
      both old and new stacks.

  - company: Etsy
    location: San Francisco
    title: Senior Software Engineer
    from: August 2007
    to: January 2009
    description: >
      Our team architected and built a new Python web application server for
      Etsy's marketplace that drastically simplified the existing codebase
      while also decreasing page-load times. I was also on a small team
      responsible for architecting, building, and deploying the "Storque"—a CMS
      application seamlessly integrated with the marketplace. The Storque
      became an essential driver of traffic and engagement... though it's now
      just called the Etsy Blog.
  - company: Securify
    location: Cupertino
    title: Technical Lead Engineer
    from: April 2004
    to: August 2007
    description: |
      At Securify, I led a team responding to industry security
      incidents—assessing potential customer impact and providing guidance or
      intrusion-detection signature coverage as appropriate. To enable timely
      and accurate responses, I designed and built a web application linking
      software vulnerabilities to corresponding signatures and automated
      detection scripts.

      It was also my duty to plan and execute signature and
      vulnerability-detection coverage for Securify's software suite, and to
      use my comprehensive knowledge of common network protocols to identify
      invalid traffic on customer networks and tailor network-traffic policies.

      I'm proud to have headed up very successful internal transitions from CVS
      to SVN (git/hg proved too much of a conceptual leap); a 90s-era version
      of Bugtraq to a contemporary one; and scattered documentation to a
      well-organized wiki.
