  <p>Hello! I'm a full-stack developer with a background in information security.
  I've been building and breaking things on the web since the ninetiesâ€”previously with companies like
  <a href="http://www.etsy.com/">Etsy</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.good.is">GOOD</a>,
  and more recently independently or with my partner as
  <a href="http://madebycabin.com/">Cabin</a>.</p>

  <p>I'm passionate about simplicity,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">text editors</a>,
  <a href="https://www.python.org/">significant whitespace</a>, and
  <a href="http://public.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/">grammar</a>.</p>
